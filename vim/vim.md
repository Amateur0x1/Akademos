Vim has several modes that each serve a specific purpose for text editing:
	1.Normal Mode: This is the default mode, used for navigating through the file and executing commands like copying, deleting, or moving text. You can’t type directly in this mode.
	2.Insert Mode: In this mode, you can directly type and edit text. To enter insert mode from normal mode, you press i.
	3. Replace Mode: This mode allows you to overwrite existing text one character at a time, replacing what’s already there as you type. You can enter replace mode by pressing R in normal mode.
	4.Visual Mode: This mode lets you select blocks of text. There are three types of visual mode:
	•	Visual: Selects text by character.
	•	Visual Line: Selects entire lines of text.
	•	Visual Block: Selects a rectangular block of text, useful for column editing.
